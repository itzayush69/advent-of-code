# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

Welcome to my Advent of Code solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual event in December where participants solve daily programming puzzles. It's a great way to improve your coding skills and have fun during the holiday season.

## Structure

Each day's solution is contained within its own directory, named `day_xx`, where `xx` is the day number (e.g., `day_01` for December 1st). Inside each directory, you will find subdirectories for each part of the puzzle, named `part_1`, `part_2`, etc. Inside each part directory, you will find:

- `solution.py`: The solution code in python.
- `solution.js`: The solution code in JavaScript.
- `input.txt`: The input data for the puzzle.

## Solutions

| Day | Puzzle | Solution |
| --- | ------ | -------- |
| 01   | [Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1) | [Python](day_01/part_1/solution.py) / [JavaScript](day_01/part_1/solution.js) |
| ... | ...    | ...      |

## How to Run

To run the solutions, navigate to the respective day's part directory and execute the solution file. For example:

For Python:
```sh
cd day_01/part_1
python solution.py
```

For JavaScript:
```sh
cd day_01/part_1
node solution.js
```
